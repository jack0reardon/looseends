# looseends
### A meta-program - Produces a (visual) directed graph of all the functions defined in your Python project so that you can identify any functions that were forgotten about and are no longer used
*A POC*

1. View all functions used across your program at a glance - provide the root directory, and the program will recursively search for .py files and pull out all function definitions
2. Visualise which functions are more central to your program over others
3. Identifies recursive functions
