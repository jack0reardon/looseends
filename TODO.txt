Move this TODO to Github
Create .gitignore

Doesn't handle:
- commented out code
- function definitions within other functions
- Two functions that have the same name in different namespaces/.py files
- The last function defined in .py file!
- Dependencies on a function that is called in __init__.py (or even in just a regular script) outside of any function definition despite this indicating that the function is in fact used/depended upon
- Classes and functions used and defined within other classes and functions
